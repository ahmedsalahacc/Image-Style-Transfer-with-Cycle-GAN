# Image-Style-Transfer-with-Cycle-GAN
Using cycle GAN for image to image translations to apply the style transfer problem in computer vision found in this paper[Cycle GAN paper] (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10593.pdf) , by Jun-Yan Zhu et. al.

In this repo, I built a cycle GAN model that learns the mapping between the summer (X) and winter (Y) domains. The model shows successful results that can be found in test_samples directory. The inspection of the model during training can be found at samples_cyclegan directory.
